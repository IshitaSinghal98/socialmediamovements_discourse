# Computational Analysis of Social Media Movement & Counter-Movement Discourse
**Author:** Ishita Singhal

## Project Overview
This project employs Computational Social Science methods to examine the linguistic and emotional divergence between social media movements (#BlackLivesMatter) and their respective counter-movements (#AllLivesMatter, #BlueLivesMatter). By analyzing unstructured Twitter data, the project decodes how different groups utilize sentiment and specific linguistic cues to mobilize, react, and shape online discourse.

## Key Features & Methodology
* **Data Engineering:** Developed a pipeline to process and clean 50,000+ rows of unstructured Twitter data using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilized **VADER** and **NLTK** to quantify affective polarities and emotional intensity across competing hashtags.
* **Linguistic Cue Extraction:** Applied computational text analysis to identify rhetorical markers that distinguish mobilization-oriented language from opposition-oriented language.
* **Findings:** Identified significant variance in moral-emotional language that predicts high-velocity engagement and group-identity reinforcement on social platforms.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLTK, VADER
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Statistical Logic:** Scikit-Learn (Classification), Descriptive Statistics

## Research Context
This work was developed as part of my research and academic coursework at University of Chicago (2021), focusing on social cognition, structural privilege, and the behavioral consequences of online social movements.
